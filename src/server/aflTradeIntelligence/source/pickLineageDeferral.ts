 * instead of `blocking`: the pick-lineage codes, and an unresolved identity whose subject is a draft
 * selection, a provider-stated pick outcome or the original club a pick transfer names (the club whose
 * entitlement is traded, which Draftguru labels by concession names the owner has rejected as club

 * they classify issues and derive, from candidate content alone, which records a promotion of a
